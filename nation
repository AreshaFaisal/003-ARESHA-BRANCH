One thing that should change about the current state of nature is the level of human exploitation and pollution.
Deforestation, plastic waste, and climate change are damaging ecosystems and endangering wildlife.
We must shift toward sustainable practices, protect natural habitats, and reduce our carbon footprint. 
A healthier relationship with nature is essential for both environmental balance and future generations' well-being.
By embracing renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting conservation, we can help restore the planetâ€™s natural harmony and ensure a thriving Earth for years to come.
